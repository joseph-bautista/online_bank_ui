# Simple Online Bank System (Frontend System)
This is a simple online banking system written in JavaScript using ReactJS Framework. I also written the backend that this frontend system uses that you can also clone. This is the link to the repository of the backend https://github.com/joseph-bautista/online_bank

# Setting up the system
1. Clone the repository by opening your terminal and run the 
> git clone https://github.com/joseph-bautista/online_bank_ui.git
2. Go to the directory of the project by running
> cd online_bank_ui 
3. Go back to the terminal and run 
> npm install
> npm start

And viola! We have set up our online bank frontend system. 

> Please also note that we need to set up backend sytem of this to use this frontend system. Otherwise you can create your own backend system with the database diagram below and update the endpoits accordingly.
